# **DESCRIPTION**

This repository has been made to demonstrate the artificial inelegance tools and algorithms that I have developed over the last two years of my studies. Majority of the projects that have been developed are done so through my own research, this repository is meant to highlight my development as a programmer and are not a standard to follow by any means.

Currently the source files and release build available are from my first artificial intelligence subject which conducted a year ago.
